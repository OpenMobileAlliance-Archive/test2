            "description": "WAP [WAPARCH] security functionality includes the Wireless Transport Layer Security [WAPWTLS], the Transport Layer Security [TLS10] and application level security, accessible using the Wireless Markup Language Script [WMLScript] and the Crypto Object [ECMACR] for ECMAScript Mobile Profile [ESMP].  For optimum security, some parts of the security functionality need to be performed by a tamper-resistant device, so that an attacker cannot retrieve sensitive data. Such data is especially the permanent private keys used in the WTLS handshake with client authentication, and for making application level electronic signatures (such as confirming an application level transaction). In WTLS, also the master secrets, protecting secure sessions, are relatively long living – which could be several days. This is in order to avoid frequent full handshakes which are relatively heavy both computationally and due to large data transfer. Master secrets are used as a source of entropy, to calculate MAC keys and message encryption keys which are used to secure a limited number of messages, depending on usage of WTLS.    The WAP Identity Module (WIM) is used in performing WTLS, TLS and application level security functions, and especially, to store and process information needed for user identification and authentication. The functionality presented here is based on the requirement that sensitive data, especially keys, can be stored in the WIM, and all operations where these keys are involved can be performed in the WIM.   An example of a WIM implementation is a smart card. In the phone, it can be the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card or an external smart card. The way which a phone and a smart card interact is specified as a command-response protocol, using Application Protocol Data Units (APDU) specific to this application. This specification is based on ISO7816 series of standards on smart cards and the related GSM specifications [GSM11.11], where applicable.   This specification concentrates on defining an interface between the part of a WAP client device that is not considered tamper-resistant, and a tamper-resistant component, the WIM.   A basic requirement for WIM implementation is that it is tamper-resistant. This means that certain physical hardware protection is used, which makes it unfeasible to extract or modify information in the module (volatile, non-volatile memory and other parts). Technology used in smart cards are examples of this kind of protection. Regular mobile phones and PDAs cannot be considered tamper-resistant. For these devices, e.g. extracting information from the module may be difficult but still feasible with a proper equipment.  This specification does not define exact requirements for tamper-resistance. Businesses can enforce certain requirements and policies using PKI based mechanisms. Applications should only accept certificates signed by Certification Authorities that are known to fulfil the requirements and policies.  PKI functionality (including WTLS and TLS client authentication with private keys, and WMLScript and ECMAScript digital signatures) can be implemented in pure software in normal PDAs or phones, using password protection, encryption etc. However, such implementations cannot be considered as WIM implementations, and are out of scope of this specification. At the same time, service interfaces defined in this specification may be useful for designing internal software interfaces for these implementations."
